/*
Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a closing pair. 
Forgetting a piece tends to happen when you're editing existing code and inserting items with one of the pair types. 
Also, take care when nesting code blocks into others, such as adding a callback function as an argument to a method.

One way to avoid this mistake is as soon as the opening character is typed, immediately include the closing match, 
then move the cursor back between them and continue coding. 
Fortunately, most modern code editors generate the second half of the pair automatically.

Fix the two pair errors in the code.

/*The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value. If youâ€™re not familiar with it, the following code shows an example of using the the method:
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(array1.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue));  // expected output: 10 */
