/*You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties name (a string), legs, tails and friends.

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as name is a string, legs and tails are numbers, and friends is an array. */


const myDog = {
    "name": "Blas",
    "legs": 2,
    "tails": 0,
    "friends": ["Mayco", "Atos", "Rosa"]
  };
