/*
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
*/
var a = 39;
const myVar = a - 6;
const difference = 45 - myVar;
console.log(difference);
